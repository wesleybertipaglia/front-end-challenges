## Instructions
In this challenge, you will design an image gallery layout. Your task is to create the HTML structure for the image gallery and apply CSS styling to make it visually appealing. While we're providing a prototype image, feel free to use your creativity to design the image gallery's look and feel.

### Requirements
1. Create an HTML structure for an image gallery that includes the following elements:
   - A grid layout to display a collection of images.
   - Navigation controls for viewing the images (e.g., previous and next buttons).
   - An enlarged view of the selected image when a user clicks on it.

2. Style the image gallery layout using CSS. You can choose colors, fonts, and layout that you prefer, but ensure it's user-friendly and visually engaging.

### Additional Guidelines
- Use appropriate HTML tags and CSS for creating a grid layout.
- Apply CSS for proper alignment and spacing of images and navigation controls.
- Ensure that the image gallery is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
