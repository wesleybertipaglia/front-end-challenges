# JavaScript Frameworks Challenges
Welcome to the JavaScript Frameworks challenges folder! In this section, you'll find a series of challenges focused on enhancing your skills in working with popular JavaScript frameworks. JavaScript frameworks provide a structured and efficient way to develop web applications, and these challenges will help you explore and master them.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of these challenges are to:

- Master the use of popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- Learn how to build dynamic and interactive web applications using a component-based approach.
- Gain hands-on experience with state management, routing, and API integration in the context of frameworks.
- Understand best practices for web application development and front-end architecture.

## Features
- **Challenge Descriptions**: Each challenge directory contains a detailed description of the task, including the problem statement, objectives, and any specific framework-related requirements.

- **Inspiring Prototype**: Some challenges include an inspiring prototype or sample application. This showcases a working example of what you're expected to build using the specific framework.

- **Example**: Each challenge directory includes example files that demonstrate one possible solution using the framework. These examples serve as references and starting points for your own solutions.

## JavaScript Frameworks
We'll explore challenges using a JS framework of your choice, we recommend one of this list:

1. **React**: React is a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Challenges in this section will focus on React components, state management, and component lifecycle.

2. **Angular**: Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework developed by Google. Challenges in this section will cover topics like components, services, and routing in Angular applications.

3. **Vue.js**: Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its simplicity and versatility. Challenges in this section will focus on Vue components, directives, and Vue Router.

4. **Ember.js**: Ember.js is a JavaScript framework that offers conventions for building ambitious web applications. Challenges will explore Ember's routing, components, and data layer.

5. **Svelte**: Svelte is a new approach to building user interfaces. Challenges in this section will introduce you to Svelte components and the Svelte way of handling state and reactivity.

## Challenge Directory Structure
Each challenge is organized as follows:

- `README.md`: A detailed challenge description and objectives.
- `prototype.png` (if applicable): An image showcasing an inspiring prototype.
- `example/`: A directory containing example files and solutions.

## To participate in a challenge:
1. Open the challenge folder you want to tackle.
2. Study the `prototype.png` (if provided) to understand the application or component you're expected to build using the specific framework.
3. Create a new folder called `solution/` to work on your solution using the framework.
4. Implement and test your solution, ensuring it meets the desired outcome.

> Optionally, you can check the `example/` to get inspired.

Feel free to explore the challenges in this folder, starting with the JavaScript framework that interests you the most. Whether you're new to frameworks or an experienced developer, these challenges will help you expand your skills in building dynamic web applications.
