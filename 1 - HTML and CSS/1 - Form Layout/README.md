## Instructions

In this challenge, you'll be creating a simple form layout. You'll need to create the HTML structure for the form and apply basic CSS styling to make it visually appealing. While we're providing a prototype image, feel free to use your creativity to design the form's look and feel.

### Requirements

1. Create an HTML form that includes the following input elements:
   - Text input fields for 'First Name' and 'Last Name.'
   - A radio button group for 'Gender' (options: Male, Female, Other).
   - Checkboxes for 'Terms and Conditions' and 'Subscribe to Newsletter.'
   - A 'Submit' button.

2. Style the form using CSS to ensure that it's visually pleasing. You can choose colors, fonts, and layout that you prefer, but make sure it's user-friendly.

### Additional Guidelines

- Use appropriate HTML tags and attributes for form elements.
- Implement CSS for proper alignment and spacing of form elements.
- Ensure that the form elements are easy to read and interact with.

### Example Code Structure

Here's a basic structure to start with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <form>
        <!-- Add your form elements here -->
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
