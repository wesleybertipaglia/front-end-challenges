# EJS Challenges
Welcome to the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) challenges folder! In this section, you'll find a collection of challenges aimed at enhancing your skills in using EJS templates to generate dynamic HTML content. EJS is a popular templating engine for JavaScript that simplifies the process of rendering dynamic data in web applications.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of these challenges are to:

- Master the fundamentals of EJS templating and its syntax.
- Learn how to integrate EJS into your web development projects.
- Practice generating dynamic HTML content using data from different sources, such as databases or API responses.
- Build skills for creating reusable templates and partials with EJS.

## Features
- **Challenge Descriptions**: Each challenge directory contains a detailed description of the task at hand, including the problem statement, objectives, and any specific templating requirements.

- **Inspiring Prototype**: Some challenges include an inspiring prototype or sample HTML structure. This provides a visual representation of the expected output and helps you understand the dynamic content to generate with EJS.

- **Example**: Each challenge directory includes example files that demonstrate one possible solution using EJS templates. These examples serve as references and starting points for your own solutions.

## EJS Topics
We'll explore challenges covering a wide range of EJS topics, including:

1. **Basic EJS Templates**: Challenges that focus on creating simple dynamic templates using EJS syntax.

2. **Data Integration**: Challenges that involve integrating EJS with data from various sources, such as JSON files, databases, or API responses.

3. **Template Reusability**: Challenges that highlight the importance of creating reusable templates and partials in EJS.

4. **Conditional Rendering**: Challenges that require conditional rendering of content based on data values.

5. **Looping and Iteration**: Challenges that involve looping through data to generate repetitive HTML structures dynamically.

## Challenge Directory Structure
Each challenge is organized as follows:

- `README.md`: A detailed challenge description and objectives.
- `prototype.png` (if applicable): An image showcasing an inspiring prototype.
- `example/`: A directory containing example files and solutions.

## To participate in a challenge:
1. Open the challenge folder you want to tackle.
2. Study the `prototype.png` (if provided) to understand the dynamic content you're expected to generate.
3. Create a new folder called `solution/` to work on your solution using EJS templates.
4. Implement and test your solution, ensuring it generates the desired dynamic HTML content.

> Optionally, you can check the `example/` to get inspired.

Feel free to explore the challenges in this folder at your own pace. Whether you're a beginner looking to master EJS or an experienced developer aiming to refine your templating skills, these challenges will help you grow as an EJS developer.
